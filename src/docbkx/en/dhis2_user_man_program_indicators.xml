  <title>Program Indicators</title>
  <para>This chapter covers how to configure and use program indicators.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The purpose of program indicators is to provide a way to produce calculated values based
      on data elements and attributes. Program indicators contain an expression and a filter, which
      in combination determines how the indicator should be evaluated.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Setup</title>
    <para>Program indicators can be managed from the "Programs and Attributes" app. Once in the app,
      navigate to Programs. A program indicator belongs to exactly one program, so click on the
      program for which you want to create an indicator and from the context menu navigate to "View
      program indicators". This will open the list of existing indicators, if any, for this
      program.</para>
    <para>To <emphasis role="bold">add</emphasis> an indicator, click the "Add new" button in the
      top right corner. This will open the new indicator screen. Provide a name, short name, code,
      description, value type, expression and filter for the indicator.</para>
    <para>To <emphasis role="bold">edit</emphasis> an indicator, click on the relevant indicator in
      the list to open the context menu and click "Edit". This will open the edit indicator screen,
      where you can modify the relevant values.</para>
    <para>To <emphasis role="bold">remove</emphasis> an  indicator, click on the relevant indicator
      in the list to open the context menu and click "Remove". Click "OK" in the confirmation dialog
      to remove the indicator.</para>

    <title>Indicator evaluation</title>
    <para>Program indicators are evaluated based on its expression and filter. The <emphasis
        role="bold">expression</emphasis> defines how the indicator is being calculated. The
      expression can contain references to various entities which will be substituted with a related
      values when the indicator is calculated:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Data elements: Will be substituted with the value of the data element for the time
            period and organisation unit for which the calculation is done.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Attributes: Will be substituted with the value of the attribute for the person /
            tracked entity for which the calculation is done.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Variables: Will be substituted with special values linked to the program, including
            incident date and date of enrollment for the person, current date and count of values in
            the expression for the time period and organisation unit for which the calculation is
            done.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Constants: Will be substituted with the value of the constant.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>The expression is a mathematical expression that can contain operators which include
      multiply, divide, plus and minus.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">filter</emphasis> is applied to events and filters the data
      source used for the calculation of the indicator. I.e. the filter is applied to the set of
      events before the indicator expression is being evaluated. The filter must evaluate to either
      true or false. It filter is applied to each individual event. If the filter evaluates to true
      then the event is included later in the expression evaluation, if not it is ignored. The
      filter can, in a similar way as expressions, contain references to data elements, attributes
      and constants.</para>
    <para>The indicator filter can in addition use logical operators including "and", "or", "&lt;",
      "&lt;=", ">", ">=". These can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately evaluates
      to true or false. E.g. one can express that multiple data elements must be a specifc value, or
      that specific attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant.</para>

    <para>You can switch between data elements, attributes, variables and constants by using the
      tabs. You can include such items into expressions and filters by double-clicking in the list.
      The buttons below the expression area can be used to insert operators.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italic">A tip to expert users:</emphasis> DHIS 2 is using the JEXL library
      which supports additional syntax for expressions which you can use at will. See the reference
      at the <ulink url="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html">project home page</ulink>.</para>
