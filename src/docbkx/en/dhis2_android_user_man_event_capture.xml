  <title>Android Event Capture App</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The event capture Android app allows you capture, modify and list events. The event
      capture app works with event-based programs in DHIS 2, which handles anonymous events not
      linked to registered entities. These programs are suitable for handling scenarios such as
      facility surveys, hospital registry summaries and training events. However the app is not tied
      to any specific domain and can potentially be utilized for any scenario of event-based
      information.</para>
    <para>The event capture app allows you to capture events offline, i.e. without Internet
      connectivity. The app will automatically synchronize events with the online DHIS 2 server
      automatically when connectivity is present. This makes the app suitable for environments where
      Internet connectivity is scarce or unstable.</para>
